1)Classes and Objects

http://skillgun.com/java/classes-and-objects/tutorial

Class : It is a blue print type from which individual objects are generated.
Object : Any real world entity that has some state(data) behaviour(functionality);


2) Memory Architecture of JRE:

Code Segment : Stores your code
Data Segment : stores static/class variables
Stack Segment : local variables
Heap Segment : contain instanse variable/ new object


3) Types of Variables

a) Local Variables : Property of Function : Life time within that block or function
b) Instance Variables : Property of Object : Life time is as long as Object is alive
c) Class/static variables : Property of Class : Life time through out the program execution

Example :

class Demo
{
 int a = 0 ; (Instance Variable - > Property of Object : Life time is as long as Object is alive)
 static int b; (Class Variable -> Property of Class : Life time through out the program execution)

 publiv void method(int a)  //(local variable)
 {
    int v = 0; (local variable)
    Demo d = new Demo();  (local variable -> Property of Function : Life time within that block or function)
 }
}


4) Constructor :

Refer : http://skillgun.com/java/constructors/tutorial
*
* Constructors :
* 1) Can be private used in singleton pattern
* 2) Constructors not have any return type
* 3) Having a return type for constructor will not give any pblm but then it will act like a normal method.
*
 Life Cycle of Constructor :
* a)Constructor will be called only after creating the object.
* b)"new" operator will create the object , not the constructor.
* c) Constructor are used to initialize the objects, and to initialize the instance variable.
*
* Note : If you make private constructor then we cannot craete objects of that class from outside world(class).

Shadowing : Basically,  Constructor are used to initialize the objects, and to initialize the instance variable.
* But if instance variable are same as local variable that we have passed with constructor. Then Shadowing will occur that will not
make use of new values that we have passed infact the default values of instance variable will be used.
* Local variable is same as instance variable;
* In this kind of scenerio local variable has given high priority than instance variable.

*What is the purpose of object ? Creating OBject or initialising instance variable ?
*Ans : Constructor is used to only initialize the object, e.i initialize the instance variable of the object.
      It is not a good practice to initialize static variables from the constructor.
      Since constructor are used to initialize the object, so it will called only after creating of the object, it is
      not the constructor but the "new" operator that will create the object in java.

* Constructor can be parametrized and can be overloaded (virtual polymorphism : static polymorphism).

* We can call constructor from other constructor in same class by using "this()" function call in the first line .


5) How many ways we can initialize instance variable ?
Ans : a) you can initialize inside constructor (issue : StackOverFlow Occur)
      b) you can initialize in static block
      c) you can initialize outside constructor but no conditional logic should be present.
