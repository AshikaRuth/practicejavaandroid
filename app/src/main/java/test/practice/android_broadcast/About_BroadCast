BroadCast Receiver :

Refer : https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts.html

Android apps can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and other Android apps, similar to the
publish-subscribe design pattern. These broadcasts are sent when an event of interest occurs.
For example, the Android system sends broadcasts when various system events occur, such as when the system boots up or the
device starts charging. Apps can also send custom broadcasts, for example, to notify other apps of something that they might
be interested in (for example, some new data has been downloaded).

****In software architecture, publish?subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers,
do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead he categorize
published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers
express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers,
if any, there are.
