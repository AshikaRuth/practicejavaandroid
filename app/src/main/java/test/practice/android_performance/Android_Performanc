TO maintain performance through following ways :

1) Use Fragments.
2) Use foreach loop as much as possible . (w.r.t JIT compiler : Good if JIT not available also).
3) Use lint
4) Use of Proguard
5) Don't use Static variables. That may create strong reference after activity destroyed.
6) Use parcelable interface for marshalling and un-marshalling the object.
