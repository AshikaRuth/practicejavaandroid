Aptitude : Time Distance   (https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/problems-on-trains/)

Question : Think and answer.
A man standing on the plateform. A train crosses him with a speed of 15m/sec in 20 minutes. The length of the plateform is 400 meter. How much time it takes to cross the plateform ? 



>>>>
A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 9 seconds. What is the length of the train?
A.	120 metres
B.	180 metres
C.	324 metres
D.	150 metres
Answer: Option D

Explanation:

Speed=		60 x	5	m/sec	=		50	m/sec.
18	3
Length of the train = (Speed x Time).

 Length of the train =		50	x 9	m = 150 m.

Two trains running in opposite directions cross a man standing on the platform in 27 seconds and 17 seconds respectively and they cross each other in 23 seconds. The ratio of their speeds is:
A.	1 : 3
B.	3 : 2
C.	3 : 4
D.	None of these
Answer: Option B

A train 360 m long is running at a speed of 45 km/hr. In what time will it pass a bridge 140 m long?
A.	40 sec
B.	42 sec
C.	45 sec
D.	48 sec
Answer: Option A

Explanation:

Formula for converting from km/hr to m/s:   X km/hr =		X x	5		m/s.
18
Therefore, Speed =		45 x	5	m/sec	=	25	m/sec.
18	2
Total distance to be covered = (360 + 140) m = 500 m.

Formula for finding Time =		Distance	
Speed
 Required time =		500 x 2	sec	= 40 sec.
25

A.	1 : 3
B.	3 : 2
C.	3 : 4
D.	None of these
Explanation:
Let the speeds of the two trains be x m/sec and y m/sec respectively.

Then, length of the first train = 27x metres,

and length of the second train = 17y metres.

	27x + 17y	= 23
x+ y
 27x + 17y = 23x + 23y

 4x = 6y

	x	=	3	.
y	2
